This Tableau project visualizes data from **SoFIFA** (2022) to scout young footballers under the age of 22. The aim of this project is to identify strong strikers by analyzing key performance attributes such as **attacking finishing**, **dribbling**, **acceleration**, and **shot power**. This visualization is designed to help scouts and analysts assess the best young talents in football, specifically focusing on offensive performance.
