## Projects

### **1. Scouting the Best Young Footballers Under 22**
This project analyzes data from **SoFIFA (2022)** to scout young footballers under the age of 22, with a focus on strikers. The dashboard visualizes key performance metrics such as **attacking finishing**, **dribbling**, **acceleration**, and **shot power**. Interactive filters allow users to explore players based on contract details, market value, wages, and more. This visualization aims to help football scouts and analysts assess potential top talents.
